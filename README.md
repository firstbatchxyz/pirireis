## PiriReis

PiriReis constructs a "hierarchical context tree" from Dria Indices, where the root node encapsulates the most generalized data concept, and the leaf nodes represent the most detailed sub-contexts. This hierarchical structure facilitates query enhancement and compatibility assessment of indices by detailing contexts at varying levels of granularity.
